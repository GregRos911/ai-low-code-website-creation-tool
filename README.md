# AI Website Builder (WordPress Plugin)

**AI Website Builder** is a custom WordPress plugin designed to bring visual, low-code website editing directly into the WordPress admin panel. It integrates the Silex editor inside WordPress and allows users to build simple web pages using a drag-and-drop interface.

The project is in active development and demonstrates how WordPress can be extended with modern UI tools like Tailwind CSS and visual builders.

## 🌟 What It Does So Far

- ✅ Loads the Silex editor UI directly into a WordPress plugin page  
- ✅ Provides a basic user interface that can generate and edit a simple web page layout  
- ✅ Responsive layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS  
- ✅ Plugin architecture integrated into the WordPress admin menu  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Platform:** WordPress (PHP Plugin)  
- **Editor Engine:** Silex (with iframe integration)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Tailwind UI components  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Alpine.js, JavaScript  
- **Deployment:** WordPress local environment (planned for live demo)  

## 🚧 Planned Features

- ✨ AI-assisted layout generation from user prompts  
- ✨ Visual manipulation of content (text, images, layouts)  
- ✨ Export layouts as WordPress pages or templates  
- ✨ Integration with Tailwind CDN and layout presets  
- ✨ Support for pre-built templates and future SaaS expansion  

## 🔌 Future Development Plan

The next phase of the project will integrate an AI-powered layout generation API running on a VPS. This separation of concerns will allow the plugin to request page layouts from the AI and insert them directly into the editor for visual manipulation.
