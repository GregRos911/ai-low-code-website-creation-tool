# AI Website Builder (WordPress Plugin)

**AI Website Builder** is a custom WordPress plugin designed to bring visual, low-code website editing directly into the WordPress admin panel. This project is in active development and demonstrates an early integration of a drag-and-drop editor (Silex) with support for Tailwind CSS components.

The goal is to give users—especially non-developers—the ability to build and edit pages visually, with minimal code, from inside WordPress.

## 🌟 What It Does So Far

- ✅ Loads the Silex editor UI directly into a WordPress plugin page  
- ✅ Responsive layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS  
- ✅ Custom component development using Tailwind UI elements  
- ✅ Plugin architecture established and integrated into WordPress admin menu  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Platform:** WordPress (PHP Plugin)  
- **Editor Engine:** Silex (with iframe integration)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Tailwind UI components  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Alpine.js, JavaScript  
- **Deployment:** WordPress local environment (planned for live demo)  

## 🚧 Planned Features

- ✨ AI-assisted layout generation from user prompts  
- ✨ Visual manipulation of content (text, images, layouts)  
- ✨ Export layouts as WordPress pages or templates  
- ✨ Integration with Tailwind CDN and layout presets  
- ✨ Support for pre-built templates and future SaaS expansion  

## 🔌 Future Development Plan

In future versions, layout generation will be handled by a separate AI-powered API running on a VPS (using Ollama + an open-source model). This modular API will respond to prompts from the editor and return layout suggestions to be rendered inside Silex—keeping logic clean and scalable.
